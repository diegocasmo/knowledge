# The A* Search Algorithm

### Path Finding
Finding the optimal path between two states is a common problem in many areas of computer science such as planning, games, and scheduling. Given an initial position, goal, and a transition model, the objective is to find an optimal path towards the goal state. Optimal may be in terms of time (generally shortest) or resources (generally minimal use) or both.

The goal of this blog post is to explain the A* search algorithm, a well known and popular path finding algorithm which is guaranteed to find the goal state in the least number of steps (more on this later).
