Uppsala's International Students Orientation Week

One week prior to the beginning of classes, the International Committee (IK) and the Student Nations arrange a large number of activities with the goal of welcoming international students to Uppsala. These activities are a great opportunity to get to know the city, culture, meet new friends, and of course, learn more about the Student Nations. Since classes have not started yet, and the weather is still very nice outside, this is the perfect time to go out and experience many of things Uppsala has to offer!

During this year’s orientation week activities included guided tours of the city, FIKA, Swedish games, beer pong, pub-quizzes, mini waffle day, a light hike to see viking graves at Gamla Uppsala, among many others.

Besides the events organized by the IK and the Student Nations, I highly recommend taking a look at the “Nationsguiden” app (an official app to check what is going on at Uppsala's Student Nations) and see if there is a restaurant, pub, or FIKA open and go there with your friends as well. Going to a Student Nation outside of the organized events is also a great way to learn more about a nation, meet some of its members, and determine if it is a nation you would like to join or not.

It might also be the case that the department you will study in has also organized a few welcome activities. Make sure you go to these as well such that you can get to know your classmates and in some cases get free food too!
