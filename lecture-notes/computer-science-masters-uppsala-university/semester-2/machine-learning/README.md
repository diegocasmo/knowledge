### Content
The course introduces various machine learning techniques, with a focus on natural computation methods. The course is divided into a theoretical part (4 credits) and a practical part (6 credits).

Theoretical part

The theoretical part consists of lectures and written course material on various topics, including (but not limited to)

Learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning).
Artificial neural networks for classification, function approximation and clustering.
Reinforcement learning methods and Temporal Difference Learning.
Evolutionary computing (genetic algorithms, genetic programming).
Swarm Intelligence (ant colony optimisation, particle swarm optimisation).

Practical part

The practical part consists of lab assignments and a project assignment. The subject of the project assignment is open for the students to define themselves, but must be approved before the work begins.
