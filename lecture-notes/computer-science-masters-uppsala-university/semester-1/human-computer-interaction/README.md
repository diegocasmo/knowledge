### Content
Human-computer interaction or HCI is the study of interaction between users and computers. The course describes theories of cognitive psychology and how knowledge of the human capabilities can influence the way in which we construct technical systems. Interaction between users and computers occurs at the user interface, which includes both software and hardware, for example, general-purpose computer peripherals and large-scale mechanical systems, such as aircraft and power plants. The course presents methods for analyzing users, work tasks and technical systems. Different methods of measuring usability are examined.
