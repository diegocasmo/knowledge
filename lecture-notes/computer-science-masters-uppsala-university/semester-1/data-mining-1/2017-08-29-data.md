### Data
- attribute v.s. attribute values
  - same attribute can be mapped to different attribute values (measure age in years or months)
  - different attributes can be mapped to the same set of values (id and age are both integers)
  - properties of attributes values can be different (id has no limit, but age has a maximum and minimum value)
- types of attributes
  - nominal (categorical) —> =, !=
    - used for labeling variables, without any quantitative value
    - examples: gender, hair color, where do you live?, zip code, employee id, eye color
  - ordinal (categorical) —> =, !=, <, >
    - the order of the values is what’s important and significant, but the differences between each one is not really known
    - examples: in a scale from 1-5 - how happy are you?, grades, hardness of minerals, {good, better, best}, street numbers
  - interval (numerical) —> =, !=, <, >, +, -
    - interval scales are numeric scales in which we know not only the order, but also the exact differences between the values
    - examples: temperature in c or f, calendar dates
  - ratio (numerical) —> =, !=, <, >, +, -, *, /
    - they tell us about the order, they tell us the exact value between units, and they also have an absolute zero–which allows for a wide range of both descriptive and inferential statistics to be applied
      - examples: height, weight, temperature in k, monetary quantities, counts, age, mass, length, electrical current
- discrete attributes (typically nominal or ordinal)
  - a discrete attribute has a finite or countable infinite set of values
  - often represented using integer values
  - binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes
  - examples: zip codes, id numbers, counts
- continuous attributes (typically interval or ratio)
  - a continuous attributes is one whose values are real numbers
  - often represented as floating-point
  - examples: temperature, height, weight
- exception: count attributes are discrete and ratio attributes
- asymmetric attributes
  - boolean attributes which regard the presence of a non-zero value as important
- dimensionality
  - number of attributes that the object in the data set possess
- sparsity
  - the extend to which a attributes contains null (0) values
- resolution
  - the degree of detail a measurement is (measuring atmospheric pressure on a scale of hours v.s. scale of months). similar to scale.
- basic model for text documents
  - represent each document based on a list of terms
  - text processing steps:
    - tokenization: split text into tokens
    - stop-word removal: deletion of frequent words not having a definite meaning
    - stemming: reducing grammatical (and other types of) variation to common terms
  - term weighting
    - since not all terms in a document are equally significant, we can replaces 1/0 (present, not present) by weights
    - term frequency (``tf``) —> higher w: a term appears many times in a document
    - inverse document frequency (``idf``) —> lower w: a term appears in many documents
    - for each document ``d`` and term  ``t``: ``tf`` * ``idf``
      - ``tf`` number of occurrences of ``t`` in ``d``
      - ``idf=log(N/n_t)``
        - ``N`` total number of documents
        - ``n_t`` number of documents where the term ``t`` appears
