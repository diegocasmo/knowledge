# Lecture: Learning From Nature - Guest Lecture

### Learning From Nature
- natural computation
  - using computers to model/simulate natural phenomena
    - to learn more about these phenomena
    - to learn new ways to solve computational problems
    - to learn how to build computation devices from biological material
- what is learning?
  - the ability to improve over time based on experience
- three forms of learning
  - supervised
  - reinforcement
  - unsupervised
- techniques
  - artificial neural networks (ANN)
    - inspired by biological nervous systems
    - based on very simple models of biological neurons and synaptic connections
    - a network of nodes that stores information in the weights, trained by adjusting those weights (for instance, using back propagation with gradient descent)
    - can generalize to unseen data
    - example problems
      - image classification
      - video classification
      - regression
  - reinforcement learning (RL)
    - inspired by psychology, ethology and behaviorism
    - learning by trial-and-error
    - reward: an evaluation of the environmental state
    - goal: to make decisions that maximize the long term reward
    - example problems
      - autonomous robots
      - controlling elevators in an office building
      - resource allocation in computer networks
  - evolutionary computing (EC)
    - inspired by genetics, natural selection and evolution
    - used to for learning problems where the task is to maximize some measure of success (fitness)
    - the 'evolution' is controlled, so it’s more like breeding
    - genotype
      - the solution to the problem is encoded in the individual’s genotype
      - in genetic algorithms —> a string
      - in genetic programming —> a computer program
      - in evolutionary programming —> a representation of a state machine
    - example problems
      - automated design
      - scheduling
      - games
  - swarm intelligence
    - inspired by social animals
    - distributed systems without central control, useful not only to simulate, but also to solve optimization problems
    - particle swarm optimization
      - originally intended to simulate bird flocks and to model social interaction, but stands on its own as an optimization tool
    - ant colony optimization
      - family of combinatorial optimization algorithms, based on ant behavior (traveling salesman problem, scheduling, network routing)
      - stigmergy: Indirect communication and coordination, by local modification and sensing of the environment
    - cellular automata
      - massively parallel system of identical communicating state machine (cells). Used to animate/model fluids, gases, and bacteria.
