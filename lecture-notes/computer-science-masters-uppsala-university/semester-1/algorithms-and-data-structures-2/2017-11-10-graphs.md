### Basic Definitions and Applications
- notation
  - ``V`` = nodes (or vertices)
  - ``E`` = edges (or arcs) between pairs of nodes
  - captures pairwise relationship between objects
  - graph size parameters: ``n = |V|``, ``m = |E|``
- representations
  - adjacency matrix
    - ``n*n`` matrix with ``A[u][v] = 1`` if ``(u, v)`` is an edge
    - two representations of each edge
    - space proportional to ``n^2``
    - checking if ``(u, v)`` is an edge takes ``Θ(1)`` time
    - identifying all edges takes ``Θ(n^2)`` time
  - adjacency list
    - node-indexed array of lists
    - space is ``Θ(m + n)``
    - checking if ``(u, v)`` is an edge takes ``O(degree(u))`` time
      - degree = number of neighbors of ``u``
    - identifying all edges takes ``Θ(m + n)`` time
- definitions
  - a path in an undirected graph ``G = (V, E)`` is a sequence of nodes ``v1, v2, ..., vk`` with the property that each consecutive pair ``vi–1``, ``vi`` is joined by an edge in ``E``
  - a path is simple if all nodes are distinct
  - an undirected graph is connected if for every pair of nodes ``u`` and ``v``, there is a path between ``u`` and ``v``
  - a cycle is a path ``v1, v2, ..., vk`` in which ``v1 = vk``, ``k > 2``, and the first ``k – 1`` nodes are all distinct
  - an undirected graph is a tree if it is connected and does not contain a cycle
    - let ``G`` be an undirected graph on ``n`` nodes. Any two of the following statements imply the third
      - ``G`` is connected
      - ``G`` does not contain a cycle
      - ``G`` has ``n - 1`` edges

### Graph Connectivity and Graph Traversal
- breadth-first search (BFS)
  - explore outward from ``s`` in all possible directions, adding nodes one "layer" at a time
  - BFS runs in ``O(m + n)`` time if the graph is given by its adjacency representation
- connected component: find all nodes reachable from a node

### Directed Graphs and Topological Ordering
- directed graphs
  - edge ``(u, v)`` leaves node ``u`` and enters node ``v``
- strong connectivity
  - nodes ``u`` and ``v`` are mutually reachable if there is both a path from ``u`` to ``v`` and also a path from ``v`` to ``u``
  - a graph is strongly connected if every pair of nodes is mutually reachable
  - a strong component is a maximal subset of mutually reachable nodes
- a directed acyclic graphs (DAG) is a directed graph that contains no directed cycles
- a topological order of a directed graph ``G=(V, E)`` is an ordering of its nodes as ``v1, v2, ..., vn`` so that for every edge ``(vi, vj)`` we have ``i < j``
  - if ``G`` has a topological order, then ``G`` is a DAG
- if ``G`` is a DAG, then ``G`` has a topological ordering
