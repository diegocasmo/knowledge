# Lecture: Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design

Readings: Chapter 17, Fundamentals of database systems, Seventh Edition (R. Elmasri, S. Navathe).

### Indexes
- indexes are used to speed up record retrieval in response to certain search conditions
- indexes structures provide secondary access paths
- any field can be used as an index
  - multiple indexes can be constructed
- most indexes are based on ordered files
- index files are small and can be retrieved with less block accesses

### Single-Level Ordered Indexes
- ordered index similar to an index on a book
- the indexing field stores the value of the index and a pointer to the block where the record can be retrieved
- values in index are ordered
- types of single-level indexes
  - primary index
    - specified on the ``ordering`` key field of ordered file of records
    - index file is an ordered file with two keys
      - primary key
      - pointer to a disk block
    - one index entry in the index file for each block in the data file
    - disadvantage: insertion and deletion of records
      - move records around and change index values
      - solutions: use unordered overflow file, use linked list of overflow records
  - clustering index
    - used if numerous records can have the same value for the ``ordering`` field
    - file records are physically ordered on a non-key field without a distinct value for each record
    - index file is an ordered file with two keys
      - clustering field value
      - pointer to a disk block of the first appearance of the field value
  - secondary index
    - can be specified on any ``non ordering`` field
    - index file is file with two keys
      - indexing field
      - block pointer or record pointer
    - usually needs more storage and longer search time than primary index (because it's dense)
- indexes may be dense or sparse
  - dense index has an index entry for every search key value in the data file
  - sparse index has entries for only some search values
    - applicable when records are sequentially ordered on search-key

### Other Types of Indexes
- multilevel Indexes
  - designed to reduce remaining search space as search is conducted
    - index file
      - first level of the multilevel index
    - second level
      - primary index to the first level
    - third level
      - primary index to the second level
- hash indexes
  - secondary structure for file access
  - uses hashing on a search key other than the one used for the primary data file organization
  - index entries of form ``(k, pr)`` or ``(k, p)``
    - ``pr``: pointer to the record containing the key
    - ``p``: pointer to the block containing the record for that key


### Some General Issues Concerning Indexing
- physical index
  - pointer specifies physical record address
  - disadvantage: pointer must be changed if record is moved
- secondary indexes can be created for any primary record organization
  - complements other primary access methods
- tuning indexes
  - tuning goals
    - dynamically evaluate requirements
    - reorganize indexes for best performance
  - reasons for revising initial index choice
    - certain queries may take too long to run due to lack of an index
    - certain indexes may not get utilized
    - certain indexes may undergo too much updating if based on an attribute that undergoes frequent changes
